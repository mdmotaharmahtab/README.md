## Work Experience
**Jr. Machine Learning Engineer @ GIGATECH, BEXIMCO (_September 2022 - Present_)**
  - Created new state-of-the-art systems for a plethora of Bangla NLP tasks e.g. named entity recognition (NER), Parts of Speech (POS), Lemmatization, and Emotion recognition. Bangla Lemmatization and Emotion recognition systems are publicly available at [here](https://github.com/eblict-gigatech/BanLemma) and [here](https://sentiment.bangla.gov.bd/) respectively.
  - For efficient deployment of ML services which use Large Language Models (LLM), used Optimum and Onnx for onnx conversion and converted into Nvidia TensorRT(TRT) format for further optimization. Used Locust for load testing and pytorch profiler to reduce bottlenecks. Used Nvidia Triton Inference Server (TIS) as the inference server to facilitate concurrent request serving and scheduling, batch inference and response caching.
  - Created REST APIs using FastAPI for hosting ML inference endpoints. Used MongoDB for response caching in NVIDIA Triton.
  - Created data augmentation pipeline to handle the class imbalance problem in sequence tagging tasks. Formulated a general test set creation guidelines for unbiased classification performance calculation.}
  - Used Qdrant vector DB for fast semantic searching, Dask to analyze and query big dataframes, DVC for dataset versioning and MLflow for model, artifact and experiment versioning.
  - Created pipeline for Natural Language generation (NLG) in Bangla for both encoder models like BERT and auto-regressive models like GPT2. Analyzed and overcame common issues like repetitive text generation, and unmeaningful word generation in NLG for Bangla.    

**Research Assistant (Remote) @ Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) (_Septembert 2021 - December 2021_)**
- Pretrained a HuBERT model on Bangla ASR dataset for joint task of speech and speaker recognition pipeline using SpeechBrain.
- Assisted in enriching existing open source Bangla ASR datasets by adding more scirpted audion and correcting existing annotation.

**Teacher Assistant & BRAC University (_April 2020 - April 2022_)**
- Helped students with different coding assignments and helped teachers in checking scripts
- Assisted students in conducting research in various fields and submitting papers into conference.
- Assisted Teachers in lab classes and helped students with different course materials during consultation hour.

## Projects
### Bangla Clickbait Detector App
[repo](https://github.com/mdmotaharmahtab/Bangla-Clickbait-Detector-App)
-  Demo app created as a part of research work on Bangla Clickbait Detection using GAN‚ÄëTransformers. It takes a Bangla article title as input and
outputs whether the title is a clickbait or non‚Äëclickbait along with the prediction probability score. GAN‚ÄëTransformers is a Transformer network
trained in generative adversarial training framework.
- Tools used: Pytorch, Streamlit, Node.js
